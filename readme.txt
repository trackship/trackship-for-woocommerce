== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is a Shipment Tracker?
A shipment tracks one tracking number from the time it's shipped until it has been delivered, no matter how many status events were created during its life cycle.

You can add each one to TrackShip and you'll pay one price based on the combined monthly order volume of all your stores. One subscription for all your WooCommerce and Shopify stores.
= Will TrackShip affect my site’s performance?
Not at all. When you fulfill an order, the shipping information is sent to TrackShip and it does all the heavy-lifting for you, we check the status of the shipment with the shipping provider every few hours and we update your store whenever there is an update in the status, and it does not impacts your load time in any way.
