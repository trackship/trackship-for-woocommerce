/**
 * TrackShip MCP - the connections a merchant's people have made.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The connection link carries its own token, which is what lets it work from claude.ai and
 * from a phone. That token is one secret, and a store is often more than one person: the
 * owner connects Claude, a colleague connects Claude, somebody tries ChatGPT. All three
 * send the same secret, so the server cannot tell them apart -- and what cannot be told
 * apart cannot be revoked apart. Cutting one means changing the secret, which cuts everyone.
 *
 * This table is the answer. Each person who connects gets a token of their own, issued to
 * them by name when they sign in, and stored here as a hash. Revoking one row touches
 * nothing else: the link is unchanged, and everybody else keeps working without knowing
 * anything happened.
 *
 * WHAT IS STORED
 *
 * Never the token. A SHA-256 of it, which is enough to recognise a caller and useless to
 * anyone who reads the table, plus the first few characters so a merchant can tell one row
 * from another on screen. The token itself exists only in the AI client that received it.
 *
 * @package TrackShip for WooCommerce
 * @since 1.2.0
