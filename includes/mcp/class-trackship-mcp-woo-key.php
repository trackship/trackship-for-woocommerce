 * TrackShip MCP - the WooCommerce MCP key.
 *
 * WooCommerce MCP authenticates with a REST API key sent as a header, and the merchant is
 * otherwise expected to leave this screen, find WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST
 * API, get the permissions right, and carry two long strings back. This class does that
 * for them, creating exactly the same row WooCommerce's own screen creates.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT STORED
 *
 * The secret is never saved by TrackShip. It is generated, handed straight back to the
 * browser once, and forgotten -- the same contract WooCommerce's own screen offers, and
 * for the same reason: a store-wide credential belongs in the merchant's password manager,
 * not in a plugin's options where a settings export could carry it off. What is kept is
 * the key_id and the last seven characters, which is enough to show what exists and to
 * revoke it later, and is useless to anyone who reads it.
 *
 * Note the scope. A WooCommerce key opens the whole store to whoever holds it, not just
 * tracking, because the key belongs to WooCommerce and TrackShip cannot narrow it. The
 * TrackShip link is the narrow route; this one is the powerful one, and the screen says so.

	 * WHY THIS DOES NOT MAKE THE KEY
	 *
	 * It used to. One button, and a store-wide credential existed -- created by this plugin,
	 * on the merchant's behalf, opening orders, products and customers. That is a lot of
	 * authority to mint on somebody's behalf from a screen about shipment tracking, and the
	 * merchant had no moment in which they decided to do it.
	 *
	 * So they make it, on WooCommerce's own screen, where the warnings are WooCommerce's and
	 * the permissions are theirs to choose. This takes the two halves and does the part that
	 * is genuinely awkward: turning them into the config each AI client expects.
	 *
	 * The rows are built here rather than in JavaScript so that the deeplink and command
	 * shapes live in exactly one place -- trackship_mcp_client_targets() -- and the screen can
	 * never offer a client something subtly different from what the rest of the plugin
	 * documents.
