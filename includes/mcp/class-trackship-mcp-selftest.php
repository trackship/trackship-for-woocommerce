/**
 * TrackShip MCP - does the link actually work from outside?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * A merchant pastes their link into Claude and Claude says 403. The link is fine; the
 * store's own security plugin refused the request. Nothing on the AI Assistant screen can
 * see that, because the screen only knows what happens INSIDE WordPress -- and a firewall
 * that runs before WordPress is, by design, invisible from in here.
 *
 * So this calls the store's own link and reports what came back. That catches the common
 * failures outright -- a link that was never issued, a route that is off, a server error.
 *
 * It does NOT settle the firewall question, and must not pretend to. The call goes from the
 * server to its own address, which on most hosts never leaves the machine; and a firewall
 * that judges callers by address or user agent has no quarrel with its own server. A pass
 * here therefore means "the link works", not "an outside service can reach it" -- and when
 * a security plugin is installed, the result says exactly that.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO
 *
 * It cannot fix the block. A plugin cannot talk its way past a firewall protecting the
 * application it is part of -- Wordfence's WAF runs as an auto_prepend_file and All In One
 * WP Security writes .htaccess rules, so both answer before a single line of this plugin
 * has run. Pretending otherwise would mean shipping a "fix" that quietly does nothing.
 *
 * What it can do is turn "Claude says 403 and I have no idea why" into "your security
 * plugin blocked it, here is the path to allow" -- which is the difference between a
 * support ticket and a merchant fixing it in a minute.
 *
 * @package TrackShip for WooCommerce
 * @since 1.0.0
