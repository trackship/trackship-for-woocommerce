/**
 * TrackShip MCP - getting the connection past the store's own bad-bot list.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR
 *
 * Security plugins ship a list of user agents to refuse, inherited from the days when the
 * things worth blocking announced themselves. Those lists name the Python and Perl HTTP
 * libraries -- and the services behind AI assistants are written in exactly those. So a
 * store can have a working link, a correct path and a valid token, and still refuse the one
 * caller it meant to allow.
 *
 * It is worse than it sounds, because the refusal is selective. An assistant's tool calls
 * arrive under its own name and get through; its sign-in service arrives under a library
 * name and does not. The merchant sees an assistant that connects, lists its tools, and
 * then cannot be signed into -- with nothing anywhere saying why.
 *
 * WHY THE PLUGIN CANNOT SIMPLY HANDLE IT
 *
 * The refusal happens in Apache, before any PHP runs. There is nothing to intercept. The
 * only place to answer it is the same file the rule lives in.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WRITES
 *
 * Four lines that say "requests to this plugin's own path are done being rewritten". Placed
 * at the top of .htaccess, they run before the bad-bot rules and stop those rules matching
 * this path -- and only this path. Nothing else on the site changes, and no rule is deleted:
 * the store's protection is exactly as it was for every other URL.
 *
 * NEVER WITHOUT BEING ASKED
 *
 * A plugin that edits .htaccess on its own is a plugin that can take a site down on its own.
 * This runs when a merchant presses a button, having been told what it does, and it can be
 * undone by pressing another. It writes through WordPress's own insert_with_markers(), backs
 * the file up first, and checks its work by making a real request afterwards -- because the
 * only honest way to report a fix to a problem this invisible is to reproduce the problem
 * and show it gone.
